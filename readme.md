Owner [Freek Van der Herten](https://twitter.com/freekmurze) gave a talk on the dashboard at Laracon EU where he explained how the dashboard works behind the screens. The talk was recorded and published [on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtB_rTh61Zo).

## Installation

Install this package by running cloning this repository and install like you normally install Laravel.

- Run `composer install` and `npm install yarn`
- Run `yarn` and `yarn run dev` to generate assets
- Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill your values (`php artisan key:generate`, database, pusher values etc)
- Create sqlite database `touch database/database.sqlite`
- Run `php artisan migrate --seed`, this will seed a user based on your `BASIC_AUTH` `.env` values
- Start php server `php -S localhost:5000 -t public`

Jira data:
- Fill jira host, user and password ([or api token](https://confluence.atlassian.com/cloud/api-tokens-938839638.html)) to `.env` file
- Crawl data by console command `php artisan dashboard:fetch-jira` or `php artisan dashboard:update` for fetching all services

That's all! Open the dashboard in your browser.
